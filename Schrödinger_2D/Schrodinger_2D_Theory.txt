Numerical Solution of the 2D Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation
===================================================================

Problem:
--------
We aim to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a 2D infinite square potential well:

    - (∂²ψ/∂x² + ∂²ψ/∂y²) = E ψ

The domain is [0, L] × [0, L], where the potential V(x, y) = 0 inside the well and infinite outside. The boundary conditions are ψ = 0 at the walls.

Discretization:
---------------
We discretize the 2D domain using a grid of N x N interior points. The Laplacian operator in two dimensions is approximated using finite differences:

    ∂²ψ/∂x² ≈ (ψ_{i+1,j} - 2ψ_{i,j} + ψ_{i-1,j}) / dx²
    ∂²ψ/∂y² ≈ (ψ_{i,j+1} - 2ψ_{i,j} + ψ_{i,j-1}) / dx²

This leads to a sparse matrix representation of the Hamiltonian H.

Kronecker Product Construction:
------------------------------
We construct the Hamiltonian H as the sum of two Kronecker products:

    H = T ⊗ I + I ⊗ T

Where:
- T is the 1D tridiagonal matrix representing the kinetic energy operator in 1D.
- I is the identity matrix of size N.

Each eigenvalue of H corresponds to an energy level, and the corresponding eigenvector gives the wavefunction ψ(x, y) flattened into a 1D array.

Eigenvalue Problem:
-------------------
We solve the matrix eigenvalue problem:

    H ψ = E ψ

to find the eigenvalues (energy levels) and eigenvectors (wavefunctions).

Interpretation:
---------------
The eigenvalues correspond to the energy levels of the particle in the 2D well.
The eigenvectors are reshaped to N x N arrays and squared to obtain the probability density |ψ(x, y)|².

Visualization:
--------------
The first few probability densities |ψ(x, y)|² are plotted to visualize the quantum states.

Note:
-----
- The wavefunctions are separable and follow ψ_{n_x, n_y}(x, y) = φ_{n_x}(x) φ_{n_y}(y)
- Energies are given by E_{n_x, n_y} = π² (n_x² + n_y²) / L² in atomic units.
- Numerical results agree well with analytical solutions.
