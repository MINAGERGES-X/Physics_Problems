INTERACTIVE PHYSICS PROBLEM SOLVER – A FRIENDLY GUIDE 
=========================================================

Think of this mini‑app as a   pocket physics lab  : you pick a question,
enter a few numbers, and instantly see what Nature replies.  
Whether you’re a student checking homework, a teacher doing a live
demo, or a curious mind who just wants to know how high that football
will fly, this script keeps the math tidy and the answers neat.

What Can It Do?
──────────────────────────
The menu bundles  10 classic topics  that show up everywhere from
high‑school tests to first‑year engineering courses.  Each one is
powered by a time‑tested equation:

1.  Kinematics  –   How fast will it be going?    
   Final velocity when acceleration stays constant:  
   `v = u + a t` 

2.  Projectile Motion  –   How far & how high?    
   Range `R = v² sin 2θ / g`, Height `H = v² sin² θ / 2g` citeturn0search1

3.  Newton’s Second Law  –   What force do I need?    
   `F = m a` 

4.  Work & Energy  –   How much work is that?    
   `W = F d` 

5.  Simple Harmonic Motion  –   How long is one oscillation?    
   `T = 2π√(m/k)` 

6.  Electric Field  –   How strong is the field?    
   `E = k q / r²` 

7.  Thermodynamics  –   Work in an isothermal expansion    
   `W = P₁ V₁ ln(V₂/V₁)` 

8.  Relativity  –   Kinetic energy near light‑speed    
   `K = m c² (γ − 1)` 

9.  Fluid Mechanics  –   Pressure at depth    
   `ΔP = ρ g h` 

10.  Wave Mechanics  –   Finding frequency    
    `f = v / λ`

How It Works
──────────────────────────
•  Pick and play:  type a menu number (0–10).  
•  Smart prompts:  the script asks only for the quantities it needs
  and checks that you enter real numbers – no crashes, no cryptic errors.  
•  Instant feedback:  answers come out with three‑digit precision and
  friendly units.  
•  Modular design:  each calculation lives in its own function, so you
  can bolt this toolkit onto bigger projects or notebooks.

Why It’s Useful
──────────────────────────
-  Students  can double‑check problems in seconds and focus on
    why   the physics works, not just the arithmetic.  
-  Teachers  can run quick demos in class or during online sessions
  without fiddling with spreadsheets.  
-  Hobbyists & coders  get a clean, commented template showing how to
  turn formulas into reusable Python functions.
