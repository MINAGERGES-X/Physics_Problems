| Goal                   | Solve Schrödinger equation in an infinite well             |
| Method                 | Finite difference method with tridiagonal matrix           |
| Hamiltonian            | Discretized second derivative for kinetic energy           |
| Potential              | Infinite at walls → enforce boundary condition manually    |
| Eigenvalues            | Approximate quantized energies $E_n = n^2\pi^2 / (2L^2)$   |
